                                We are finally getting that summer heat! That may not be a good thing for some of you, but I don't mind the heat. Be sure
                                to tune into the blog and my facebook page for the most up to date news and images. I will
                                be working to fully update my galleries with the new images from the end of last year through
                                2014. I have a lot of images to get on here, so stay tuned!

                            <p>
                                Joey Lounsury is a 16-year old photographer who specializes in various aspects of photography including; aviation, sports,
                                automobiles, wildlife, landscapes, and macros. Joey began his photographic endeavour with
                                his main subject being birds, but has since moved on to include a very wide array of subjects
                                that he photographs. After receiving a Nikon D40, a beginner DSLR camera, Joey took classes
                                on how to use the camera as well as creative mindsets to make good images. However, Joey
                                is 95% self taught. As he always says, "Experience comes from looking through the viewfinder
                                and learning what the result will be. You can read as many books as you want, but nothing
                                will beat the learning experience of either failing or making the shot." Joey has won multiple
                                awards, both regionally and nationally. He is a member of the Candlewood Camera Cub and has
                                acheived multiple 1st and 2nd place awards with the honor of receiving the 2011 B&W Print
                                of the Year Award. He has also received honorable mentions in two worldwide photo contests
                                including the Great Backyard Bird Count photo contest, which had over 6,000 entries, and
                                the Photographer's Forum Magazine photo contest which had over 18,000 entries. Joey is always
                                looking for new and unqie ways to make images that viewers don't see everyday. One of those
                                is with his Air2Air photography. Hanging out of a plane with an open door at 1,000 feet with
                                planes forming up 20 feet away may not be what you would call fun, but for Joey it is an
                                adrenaline rush like no other. And not to mention the photographs that come out of the shoot!
                                On top of his photography, Joey is beginning training to become a private pilot. He hopes
                                to become well versed in aerobatic flying as he gains cockpit time.
