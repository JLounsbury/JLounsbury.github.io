                        J Lounsbury Photography produces the utmost best quality prints, mats, and frames. Our workhorse printer is the Epson Stylus
                        Pro 3880 which produces stunning prints up to 17x22 in size. It uses the UltraChrome K3 Ink tehcnology
                        that produces a print that is sharp, colorful, and made to last! We print on the highest quality
                        Epson and Canson mediums to make sure you get the best possible print. Our custom matting and framing
                        compliments the print immensely. We mount the print on acid-free mounting board and use a very high
                        quality matting to compliment the print. We also cut and join custom frames. Before each print, or
                        combination of print, matting, and framing is turned out, we check the product for any unwanted blemishes.
                        All of the images in our gallery are available for printing and framing. We now have Metal Prints
                        avaiable. This is not something we do in house, but still ensure the best quality possible since
                        the quality of the work that the folks at ImageWizards (the company who mkaes the metal prints) is
                        beyond great! The image is printed on a piece of polished aluminum and is framed on the back of the
                        print for structural integrity. If you think a print looks good, wait until you see a metal print!

                        J Lounsbury Photography is now producing Custom 5x7 Greeting Cards! They are offered in either a 12-pack for $20 or singles
                        for $4. Each card comes with an envelope. The 12-pack is by far the best deal with each card costing
                        you only about $1.65. Now here's why these cards are so special! You pick the image that goes on
                        the card. If you order a 12-pack, you can put a different image on each card if you choose to do
                        so.
                    </p>

                        various orginizations and clubs. He has also led a workshop on Shorebird Photography that had over
